# Line Follower Robot (LFR)

This is an autonomous **Line Follower Robot (LFR)** project built using **Arduino Nano** and an **IR sensor array**.  
The robot continuously detects the line position and controls the motors in real time to follow the path smoothly.

## Project Highlights
- Real-time line detection using IR sensors  
- Motor control logic for smooth navigation  
- Hands-on implementation of robotics and embedded systems  
- Practical exposure to circuit connections and debugging  

## Repository Contents
- **lfr_bot_code/**  
  Arduino source code for IR sensor reading and motor control logic.

- **circuit_diagram.jpg**  
  Circuit diagram showing connections between Arduino Nano, IR sensor array, motor driver, motors, and power supply.

- **certificate.pdf**  
  Participation certificate from the Line Follower Robot workshop.

- **README.md**  
  Project overview and documentation.
