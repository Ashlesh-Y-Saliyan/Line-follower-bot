# Line Follower Robot (LFR)

This is an autonomous Line Follower Robot project built using Arduino Nano and an IR sensor array.  
The robot continuously detects the line position and controls the motors in real time to follow the path smoothly.

## Project Highlights
- Real-time line detection using IR sensors
- Motor control logic for forward, left and right turns
- Practical robotics + embedded systems implementation

## Repository Contents
- lfr_bot_code→ Arduino source code for sensor reading and motor control
- lfr_images→ Robot photos, setup images and demo/output images

Useful for robotics learning and embedded control applications.
